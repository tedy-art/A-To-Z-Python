Question 2:
Create a program that determines if a user-inputted integer is positive, negative, or zero.

Question 3:
Write a Python script that checks if a given string is empty. If it is, print "Empty," otherwise print "Not empty."

Question 4:
Implement a program that takes two numbers as input and prints the larger of the two.

Question 5:
Create a program that asks the user for their age. If the age is less than 18, print "Minor"; otherwise, print "Adult."

Question 6:
Write a function that takes a year as input and prints "Leap year" if it's a leap year, otherwise print "Not a leap year."

Question 7:

Question 9:
Create a program that determines if a given year is a century year. (A century year is a year that ends with '00'.)

Question 10:
Write a Python program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).
