### What is python

1) Python is a programming language created py Guido Van Rossum in 1991.<br>
2) It is a simple, general-purpose, dynamically typed, high-level programming language.<br>
3) It is an interpreted language that supports multiple paradigms i.e., functional approach, practical approach, modular 
approach, object-oriented approach.<br>

It is used in:<br>
1) Creating web applications.<br>
2) data science and machine learning.<br>
3) academic research.<br>
4) automation and many more.<br>

### Variables and Data Types
variables:<br>
A variable in programming is used to store data.

    ex.
        a = 10
        b = 1.1

Rule for naming a variable:<br>
    1) a to z OR A to Z OR 0 to 9 OR _(underscore).<br>
    2) you can't start a variable name with a digit.<br>
    3) use underscore if you want to create a variable name having two or more words.<br>

Good name for a variable:<br>
    number, salary, name, first_name, last_name, email, number1 .... more<br>
