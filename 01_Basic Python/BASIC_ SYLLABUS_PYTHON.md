# What is python

1) Python is a programming language created py Guido Van Rossum in 1991.<br>
2) It is a simple, general-purpose, dynamically typed, high-level programming language.<br>
3) It is an interpreted language that supports multiple paradigms i.e., functional approach, practical approach, modular 
approach, object-oriented approach.<br>

It is used in:<br>
1) Creating web applications.<br>
2) data science and machine learning.<br>
3) academic research.<br>
4) automation and many more.<br>

# Variables, Data Types and type conversion
## variables:<br>
A variable in programming is used to store data.

    ex.
        a = 10
        b = 1.1

#### Rule for naming a variable:<br>
    1) a to z OR A to Z OR 0 to 9 OR _(underscore).<br>
    2) you can't start a variable name with a digit.<br>
    3) use underscore if you want to create a variable name having two or more words.<br>

#### Good name for a variable:<br>
    number, salary, name, first_name, last_name, email, number1 .... more<br>

## Data Types :-
###### In python, data types are categorized into two main groups
###### 1) primitive Data Types (Basic data types)
###### 2) Non-primitive Data types (complex data types)
### Primitive Data Types :-
it is a fundamental data types provided by python language.
#### types of primitive data types:-

| sr   | Data Type          | Use/ Description                                                        | Example                     |
|------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1)   | Integer Data types | Represents whole number without any decimal point.                      | x = 14                      | 
| 2)   | Float Data types   | Represents real number and is written in decimal point.                 | x = 14.5                    |
| 3)   | Boolean Data types | Represents the truth values 'True' or 'False'.                          | is_true = True              |
| 4)   | String Data types  | Represent sequence of characters enclosed with single or double quotes. | message = "Hello, python!"  |
| 5)   | None type          | Represent null value or absence values                                  | z = None                    |

### Non-primitive Data Types :-
There are more complex data types and are derived from primitiv data types.
#### types of primitive data types:-

| sr | Data Type             | Use/ Description                                                                                                | Example                               |
|----|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 1) | list Data types       | Ordered and mutable collection of elements.                                                                     | my_list = [1, 2, 3, "Python"]         |
| 2) | Tuple Data types      | Ordered and immutable collection of elements.                                                                   | my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "Python")        |
| 3) | Set Data types        | Unordered collection of unique elements.                                                                        | is_true = True                        |
| 4) | Dictionary Data types | Unordered collection of key-value pairs.                                                                        | my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25} |
| 5) | String Data type      | Strings, while primitive, can also be considered non-primitive when they are treated as sequences of characters | x = "This is String"                  |

### First python program :
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
#### Output :
    
    'Hello, World!'

#### Ex.
```python
    name = "Jack"
    age = 22
    print(f"His name is {name} and he is {age} years old.")
```
#### Output

    His name is Jack and he is 22 years old.

| <h3> ** Take input from user **</h3> |
|--------------------------------------|
To take input from the user and store it in a variable, use input() function.

Ex.
```python
name = input ("Enter your name : ")
print(f" Hello, { name }!")
```
Output
    
    Enter your name : Tejas
    'Hello, Tejas!'

## Python Types conversion
_In programming, it's common to convert integer to float, float to string and so more,_
_the process of converting the value of one data type (int, string, float etc.) to another data type is called type conversion._

#### Python has two types of type conversion
- _Implicit Type Conversion_
- _Explicit Type Conversion_

#### 1) Implicit Type Conversion
- In implicit type conversion, python automatically converts one data type to another data type.
Ex.
    
    
    number_integer = 123
    number_float = 1.23
    
    # addition of int and float
    sum = number_integer + number_float
    print(sum)

Output

    124.23

| In this context, there are two variables, number_integer and number_float. When these two variables are added, the result is a float to prevent any potential data loss due to the inclusion of decimal values. |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

#### 2) Explicit Type conversion
In Explicit type conversion user converts the data type of object to a required data type.

we use predefined function like int(), float(), str() etc., to perform explicit type conversion.

Ex.
    
    float_num = 1.734
    
    # manually Converting to integer
    integer_num = int(float_num)

    print(f"float to integer number : {integer_num}.")
    print(f"data type of interger_num { type(integer_num)}.")

Output : 

    float to integer number : 1
    data type of integer_num <class 'int'>

conversions of one data type to another 

| conversions | details                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| int - float | we can convert integer values to floating values without data loss.                                                                                                      |
| float - int | Converting floating-point values to integers is feasible; however, it comes with a caveat â€” the risk of data loss.                                                       |
| str - int   | While it is possible to convert string values to integers, errors may occur, especially when the variable contains a combination of alphabetical characters and symbols. |
| int - str   | we can convert int to string                                                                                                                                             |
| float - str | we can convert float to string                                                                                                                                           |

# Operators
Operators are special symbols in python that carry out educational or logical computation.
The value that the operator operates on is called operand.


| sr | Operator Type	 | Description                               | 	Example                         |
|----|----------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1) | Arithmetic	    | Perform mathematical operations           | 	+, -, *, /, //, %, **           |
| 2) | Comparison	    | Compare values                            | 	==, !=, <, >, <=, >=            |
| 3) | Logical	       | Perform logical operations                | 	and, or, not                    |
| 4) | Membership	    | Test if a value is a member of a sequence | 	in, not in                      |
| 5) | Identity       | 	Compare object identities                | 	is, is not                      |
| 6) | Assignment     | 	Assign values to variables               | 	=, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, **= |



### Arithmetic operators:

1. **Addition (`+`):** Adds two operands.
   ```python
   result = 10 + 5  # result is 15
   ```

2. **Subtraction (`-`):** Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
   ```python
   result = 10 - 5  # result is 5
   ```

3. **Multiplication (`*`):** Multiplies two operands.
   ```python
   result = 10 * 5  # result is 50
   ```

4. **Division (`/`):** Divides the left operand by the right operand (always returns a float).
   ```python
   result = 10 / 5  # result is 2.0
   ```

5. **Floor Division (`//`):** Divides the left operand by the right operand and returns the floor value 
6. (rounded down to the nearest integer).
   ```python
   result = 10 // 3  # result is 3
   ```

6. **Modulus (`%`):** Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
   ```python
   result = 10 % 3  # result is 1
   ```

7. **Exponentiation (`**`):** Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.
   ```python
   result = 2 ** 3  # result is 8
   ```

### Comparison operators:

1. **Equal to (`==`):** Checks if two values are equal.
   ```python
   5 == 5  # True
   ```

2. **Not equal to (`!=`):** Checks if two values are not equal.
   ```python
   5 != 10  # True
   ```

3. **Less than (`<`):** Checks if the left value is less than the right value.
   ```python
   5 < 10  # True
   ```

4. **Greater than (`>`):** Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.
   ```python
   10 > 5  # True
   ```

5. **Less than or equal to (`<=`):** Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.
   ```python
   5 <= 5  # True
   ```

6. **Greater than or equal to (`>=`):** Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.
   ```python
   10 >= 5  # True
   ```

Examples:

```python
x = 10
y = 20

print(x == y)   # False
print(x != y)   # True
print(x < y)    # True
print(x > y)    # False
print(x <= y)   # True
print(x >= y)   # False
```

### Logical operators :
In Python are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values. They help combine multiple conditions and evaluate
the overall truth value. Here are the main logical operators in Python:

| Operator | Description                      | Example                      |
|----------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `and`    | Logical AND                      | `x and y`                    |
| `or`     | Logical OR                       | `x or y`                     |
| `not`    | Logical NOT                      | `not x`                      |

Here's a brief explanation of each logical operator:

- **Logical AND (`and`):** Returns `True` if both operands are true, otherwise `False`.
  ```python
  x = True
  y = False
  result = x and y  # result is False
  ```

- **Logical OR (`or`):** Returns `True` if at least one operand is true, otherwise `False`.
  ```python
  x = True
  y = False
  result = x or y   # result is True
  ```

- **Logical NOT (`not`):** Returns `True` if the operand is false and vice versa.
  ```python
  x = True
  result = not x    # result is False
  ```
  
### Membership operators
In Python are used to test whether a value is a member of a sequence, such as a string, list, tuple, or set. 
There are two membership operators: `in` and `not in`. Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. **`in` Operator:**
   - Returns `True` if a value exists in the sequence.
   - Returns `False` if the value is not found in the sequence.

   Example:
   ```python
   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   
   print(3 in my_list)  # True
   print(6 in my_list)  # False
   ```

2. **`not in` Operator:**
   - Returns `True` if a value does not exist in the sequence.
   - Returns `False` if the value is found in the sequence.

   Example:
   ```python
   my_tuple = ('apple', 'banana', 'orange')
   
   print('grape' not in my_tuple)  # True
   print('banana' not in my_tuple) # False
   ```
   

### Identity operators:
In Python are used to compare the memory locations of two objects. They determine whether two variables refer to the 
same object in memory. There are two identity operators in Python: `is` and `is not`.

Here's a brief explanation of each identity operator:

| Operator | Description                                           | Example      |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `is`     | True if the operands reference the same object        | `a is b`     |
| `is not` | True if the operands do not reference the same object | `a is not b` |

Examples:

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]
z = x

print(x is y)        # False, because x and y are different objects
print(x is z)        # True, because x and z reference the same object
print(x is not y)    # True, because x and y are different objects
print(x is not z)    # False, because x and z reference the same object
```

### Assignment operators :
Assignment operators in Python are used to assign values to variables. They allow you to perform an operation and 
assign the result to a variable in a concise way. Here are the common assignment operators in Python.

1. **Assignment (`=`):** Assigns the value of the right operand to the left operand.
   ```python
   x = 5  # Assigns value 5 to the variable x
   ```

2. **Addition Assignment (`+=`):** Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
   ```python
   y = 10
   y += 5  # Equivalent to y = y + 5
   ```

3. **Subtraction Assignment (`-=`):** Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result 
to the left operand.
   ```python
   z = 15
   z -= 3  # Equivalent to z = z - 3
   ```

4. **Multiplication Assignment (`*=`):** Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to 
the left operand.
   ```python
   a = 2
   a *= 4  # Equivalent to a = a * 4
   ```

5. **Division Assignment (`/=`):** Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to 
the left operand.
   ```python
   b = 10
   b /= 2  # Equivalent to b = b / 2
   ```

6. **Floor Division Assignment (`//=`):** Performs floor division on the left operand by the right operand and 
assigns the result to the left operand.
   ```python
   c = 10
   c //= 3  # Equivalent to c = c // 3
   ```

7. **Modulus Assignment (`%=`):** Calculates the modulus of the left operand divided by the right operand and assigns
the result to the left operand.
   ```python
   d = 7
   d %= 4  # Equivalent to d = d % 4
   ```

8. **Exponentiation Assignment (`**=`):** Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand and assigns the
result to the left operand.
   ```python
   e = 2
   e **= 3  # Equivalent to e = e ** 3
   ```

# Control Flow:
#### 1. if__elif__else statement
#### 2. while loops
#### 3. for loops


| 1. if statement  |
|------------------|
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics : 
- Equal : `a == b`
- Not Equal : `a != b`
- Less than : `a < b`
- Less than and equal to : `a <= b`
- Greater than : `a > b`
- Greater than and equal to : `a >= b`

These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loop.
An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword
Ex
```python
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
    print(f"{b} is greater than {a}.")
```
output
```python
'200 is greater than 33'
```
| 1.2 Elif Statement |
|--------------------|
The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

Example
```python
a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
```
Output:
```output
   a and b are equal
```

| 1.3 Else Statement |
|--------------------|
The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

Example
```python
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")
```
Output:
```output
   a is greater than b
```

| 2. while loops |
|----------------|
Python while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied.

Syntax:
```python
while condition:
    # body of while loop
```
ex.
```python
i = 1
n = 5

while i <= n:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
```
output:
```output
1
2
3
4
5
```
#### The `break` Statement
with the `break` statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true.

Ex. 
```python
i = 1
while i < 6:
    print(i)
    if i == 3:
        break
    i += 1
```
output :
```python
1
2
3
```
#### The `continue` Statement
with the `continue` statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next.

Ex. Continues to the next iteration if i is 3:
```python
i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)
```
Output:
```python
1
2
4 # 3 is not display
5
6
```
#### The `else` Statement
with the `else` statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:
Example:
```python
i = 1
while i < 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1
else:
    print("i is no longer less than 6")
```

| 3. for loops |
|--------------|
A for loop is used to iterating over a sequence (list, tuple, dictionary, set or string).
Ex. 
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```
Output:
```output
apple
banana
cherry
```
#### Looping Through a String
Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters:

Example

Loop through the letters in the word "banana":
```python
for x in "banana":
  print(x)
```
Output:
```python
b
a
n
a
n
a
```
| Note:<br/> In `for` loop, we can use operations like break, continue statement like we used in `while` loop |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

#### The `range` function : 
To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the `range()` function,

Example :

Using the `range()` function:

```python
for x in range(6):
  print(x)
```
Output:
```python
0
1
2
3
4
5
