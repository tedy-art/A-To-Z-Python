    "Generators are very easy to implement, but a bit difficult to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are used to create iterators, but with different approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are simple functions which returns an itrable set if items, one at a time, in a special way.\n",
    "\n",
    "When iterator over set of item starts using the for statement, the generator is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the generator's function code reaches a \"yield\" statement, the generator yields its execution back to the for loop, returning a new value from the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generator function can generate as many values(possibly infinite) as it wants, yielding each one in it turn."

    "### Simple Explanation with Analogies\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`return`**: Think of `return` like finishing a race and crossing the finish line. Once you cross it, the race is over, and you get your result. The function completes and exits, providing the final outcome.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def add(a, b):\n",
    "      return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "  result = add(3, 5)  # Returns 8\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`yield`**: Imagine `yield` as taking a break during a long journey. You stop at various checkpoints, but you donâ€™t finish the journey completely. Instead, you can resume from where you left off whenever you want. This is useful for generating a series of results over time without consuming a lot of memory.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def count_up_to(max):\n",
    "      counter = 1\n",
    "      while counter <= max:\n",
    "          yield counter\n",
    "          counter += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "  for number in count_up_to(5):\n",
    "      print(number)  # Prints 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 one at a time\n",

    "### Practice Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Understanding**: What does the `return` statement do in a function?\n",
    "2. **Generator Function**: Write a simple generator function using `yield` to generate the first 5 even numbers.\n",
    "3. **Memory Efficiency**: Explain why `yield` can be more memory efficient than `return` for generating large sequences.\n",
    "4. **State Retention**: How does a function using `yield` retain its state between calls?\n",
    "5. **Use Case Identification**: Provide a scenario where using `yield` would be more beneficial than `return`.\n",
