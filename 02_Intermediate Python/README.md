# Object-Oriented Programming(OOP):
1) Basic of OOP
2) classes
3) objects
4) encapsulation
5) abstraction
6) inheritance
7) polymorphism

1) Basic of OOP:
- Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects to structure code.
- In python, everything is an object, and the language supports OOP principle.
- Here are the basic concepts of object-oriented programming in python :
