**Medium:**

1. Define a class `Animal` with attributes `name` and `sound`. Create subclasses `Dog` and `Cat` inheriting from `Animal` with their own implementation of `sound`.
2. Implement a class `Shape` with methods `area()` and `perimeter()`. Derive classes `Rectangle` and `Circle` from `Shape`, overriding necessary methods.
3. Write a class `Person` with attributes `name` and `age`. Derive a subclass `Employee` from `Person` with an additional attribute `salary`.
4. Design a class `BankAccount` with methods `deposit()` and `withdraw()`. Derive classes `SavingsAccount` and `CheckingAccount` from `BankAccount`.
5. Create a class `Vehicle` with methods `start()` and `stop()`. Derive classes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, and `Truck` from `Vehicle`.
6. Implement a class `Employee` with attributes `name` and `salary`. Derive classes `Manager` and `Developer` from `Employee` with additional attributes.
7. Write a class `Shape` with methods `area()` and `perimeter()`. Derive classes `Rectangle`, `Triangle`, and `Circle` from `Shape`.
8. Design a class `Animal` with methods `move()` and `sound()`. Derive classes `Bird` and `Fish` from `Animal` with their own implementations.
9. Create a class `Vehicle` with attributes `make` and `model`. Derive classes `Car` and `Motorcycle` from `Vehicle` with additional attributes.
10. Implement a class `Employee` with attributes `name`, `age`, and `position`. Derive classes `Manager` and `Worker` from `Employee` with additional attributes.
