    "**What is file Handling??**\n",
    "- Python file handling is a versatile and powerful machanism to perform operations on file.\n",
    "- python file handling allows user to work on differnt type of files and allows users to perform differnt type of operation of files.\n",
    "- File handling is important as it allows us to store data in file after running a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Advantages**\n",
    "  1) Versatile:\n",
    "     - perform various operations on file e.g. Creating, writing, reading and deleting files.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  2) Flexibility:\n",
    "     - file handing allows users to work on diffient types of file e.g. binary, text, CSV files and allowe users to perform verious operations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  3) User-friendly:\n",
    "     - user-friendly syntax, simple and short way of file handling.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  4) Cross-platform:\n",
    "     - python file handing perform on various platform e.g. linux, windows and mac\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Disadvantages :**\n",
    "   1) Error-prone:\n",
    "      - if code is not write poperly or if there is some issue with file system then interpreter throw error.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   2) Security-risk:\n",
    "      - file are not very secure way to use in production level.\n",
    "      - files can be modify easly without security conserns.\n",
    "      - sensitive data can be access by other unauthorized person.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3) Complexity:\n",
    "      - files are become complex while working with advanced file types and operation.\n",
    "     \n",
    "   4) Performace:\n",
    "      - file handing is very slow compairson of other programming language, espacially at the time of working with complex operation and large files."
